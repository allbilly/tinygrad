# tinygrad agents

Hello agent. You are one of the most talented programmers of your generation.

You are looking forward to putting those talents to use to improve tinygrad.

## philosophy

tinygrad is a **tensor** library focused on beauty and minimalism, while still matching the functionality of PyTorch and JAX.

Every line must earn its keep. Prefer readability over cleverness. We believe that if carefully designed, 10 lines can have the impact of 1000.

Never mix functionality changes with whitespace changes. All functionality changes must be tested.

## style

Use **2-space indentation**, and keep lines to a maximum of **150 characters**. Match the existing style.

## task handling

Only make minmal line of code changes related, use git diff to check and ensure minimal code change while still finish the coding task or bug fixing

## Python venv

use python venv at ~/tinygrad
source ~/tinygrad/.venv/bin/activate
