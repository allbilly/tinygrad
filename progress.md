# Rockchip EW / OUT=5 progress

Branch: `rockchip-2608-ew`  
Focus: half ADD/MUL (and gemm via gather + EW) on DPU with **OUT_PRECISION=5** for tol match. No CPU `host_sum`.

## Test status

| Test | Status |
|------|--------|
| Pointwise ADD/MUL | **pass** — mtx512 ≤8/chunk, PC-chain 64, no soft-reset |
| `test_small_gemm` (8×8) | **pass** — ≪ old ~4.5s reset-bound path |
| `test_gemm_fp16` (64×64) | try after ship; was impractical under reset storm |
| eye / padded / range gemms | `RKPLAN_REJECT` (plan) |

## Shipped path (mtx512 OUT=5)

Source: [mtx512/rk3588-npu](https://github.com/mtx512/rk3588-npu) (`ref/rk3588-npu`) — NC1HWC2, fp32-out **C2=4**.

- **OUT_PRECISION=5**, contiguous half in / fp32 out per chunk.
- Chunk: `CHANNEL=n-1`, `W=H=0`, `DST_SURF_STRIDE=1<<4`, `SURFACE_ADD=4<<4`, `size_e=1` (`size_e=3` hangs on EW).
- **`n≤8` per task**; `n>8` → 64B-aligned slots, PC-chain up to **64** chunks/ioctl.
- **No soft-reset** on the hot path (`reset_npu()` remains for recovery only).

### Why not elementwise WIDTH alone

Naive `CHANNEL=7` + WIDTH only got first **4** exact on `n=8`: one fp32 atom = C2=4 floats.

### Why not the old 4/64B + reset path

`ref/rk3588/examples/elementwise.py` 4-elem/64B packing + `ACT_RESET` every ≤16-tile chain made warm 8×8 ~95% soft-reset (~106ms × 15).

## 2026-08-07 — after mtx512 ship (no soft-reset)

### Warm 8×8 gemm profile (`test_small_gemm` call ~0.22s incl. torch/ref; program `__call__` alone)

| Component | Time | Share of `__call__` |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| emit+patch | ~3.9 ms | ~47% |
| ioctl submit | ~2.6 ms | ~31% |
| cvt fp32→f16 (host) | ~0.9 ms | ~10% |
| gather | ~0.8 ms | ~9% |
| half_out | ~0 ms | — |
| soft-reset | **0** | — |
| **`__call__` total** | **~8.4 ms** | |

- **Ioctls: 15** (`dev.submit_count` delta). One PC-chain per logical EW op.
- Shape: 15 EW ops × 64 elems → 8 chunks/op → **120 chunks**, flushed per-op (not across ops).
- Old path: ~15× soft-reset ≈ 95% of ~1.6–4.5s realize. Soft-reset removed; wall is now emit + NPU submit + host cvt.

### Why not one ioctl?

Each OUT=5 stage writes **fp32**; next stage RDMA expects **half**. Runtime does host `_fp32_slots_to_half` after every op with `cvt_scratch` set. A PC-chain is NPU-only (no CPU between tasks), so dependent MUL/ADD tree stages cannot share one submit under the current OUT=5 + half-in contract. Within one op, the 8 chunks already share one ioctl.

### Host cast

Yes — NPU writes fp32 into the 64B slot; CPU `f32.astype(np.float16)` in place (`_fp32_slots_to_half`) before the next EW or final `half_out`. That is the ~0.9 ms cvt bucket (×15 for 8×8 gemm).

### Option: switch back to OUT_PRECISION=2 (fp16 out)

Would unlock:
- No host cvt between stages → dependent ops can PC-chain → **far fewer / one ioctl** for gemm tree
- Contiguous half tiles (elementwise.py: up to ~64k elems/task), not mtx512 ≤8 for fp32 C2=4
- Recipe notes from `elementwise.py`: `out_precision=2`, `OUT_CVT_SCALE=(1<<16)|1`, CHANNEL=7 + WIDTH packing (not the OUT=5 surf atom path)

Caveat: for the gemm ADD tree, OUT=5 already casts to half after every stage, so accumulate between levels is already half. OUT=2 mainly removes barrier/cvt cost; deep gemm vs torch wider-accum `5e-3` may still miss the same way a pure half chain did. Keep OUT=5 if single-op “f32 ALU then cast once” exactness still matters for pointwise refs.

**Not switched yet** — probe `test_small_gemm` / pointwise under OUT=2 before changing the shipped path.

---

## 2026-08-07 — flexible OUT precision (`ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT`)

Config: `ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp32|fp16` (default **fp32**). Stored on `RKImage.out_precision` (RKIM v11, flags bits 8–15).

| Mode | OUT | Layout | Host cvt | Cross-op chain |
|------|-----|--------|----------|----------------|
| `fp32` (default) | 5 | mtx512 ≤8 / 64B | yes | no |
| `fp16` | 2 | contiguous half (elementwise WIDTH) | no | yes |

### Warm 8×8 gemm with `ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16`

| Metric | fp32 (prior) | fp16 |
|--------|--------------|------|
| ioctls | 15 | **1** |
| warm realize (`__call__` path) | ~8–11 ms | **~5.4 ms** |
| pytest `test_small_gemm` call | ~0.10–0.22 s | **~0.08 s** |
| maxabs vs f32/torch matmul | (passes 5e-3) | ~0.0078 (passes 5e-3) |

Pointwise ADD/MUL also pass under fp16 (submit counts drop: e.g. `test_add` 6→1).

---

## 2026-08-07 — PC-chain buffers + medium gemm sweep

### Bigger regcmd/task floors (not a hard 23-task HW cap)

Symptom: gemm N=12 → **23** EW ops in one ioctl → `TimeoutError` errno 110; chains of 22 and 24 worked. Suspected 4096B scratch — **not** a hard max of 23 tasks (`struct_rknpu_task`×23 ≈ 920B; 23× fp16 EW regcmd ≈ 4048B still ≤4096, while 24 needs two pages and already succeeded after realloc).

Fix (match allbilly `elementwise.py`): raise floors to **regcmd 64KiB**, **task 16KiB**. After that, chain length 23 and **12×12 gemm** both pass.

Refs: `ref/allbilly-rk3588` / `tinygrad/ref/rk3588` — `experimental/pcchain.md` (EW: `AMOUNTS = next body qword count`); no documented “max 23 tasks”.

### `test_medium_gemm` advance (`ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16`, +1 N, 30s wall cap)

| N | Result |
|---|--------|
| 9–11 | ok (before bigger buffers; 12 timed out on 23-task chain) |
| 12–17 | ok after 64KiB/16KiB floors (~70–140 ms, 1 ioctl) |
| **18** | **tol fail** vs f32 matmul ref (maxabs≈0.0105 > 5e-3) — stopped |

At this point `test_medium_gemm` was `(17,17)@(17,17)`. `test_small_gemm` remains `(8,8)@(8,8)`.

---

## 2026-08-07 — EW `IN_PRECISION=5` (fp32-in) HW probe

TRM (`docs/rk3588_trm.md` / allbilly) lists `in_precision=3'd5` = fp32 as a valid encoding. allbilly/npu working recipes never use it for EW: always `IN=2` + `MRDMA_FP16TOFP32_EN(1)`, even when `OUT=5`.

### What we tried (single EW ADD, n=8, recover via `simple_add.py` each trial)

| Config | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `OUT=5 IN=2` mtx (shipped) | **OK** exact |
| `OUT=2 IN=2` WIDTH (shipped) | **OK** exact (on clean NPU) |
| `IN=5 OUT=5 PROC∈{2,5}` × `erdma_ds∈{0,1,2,3}` × mtx/WIDTH × fp32 buf | **TimeoutError** every time |
| `IN=5 OUT=2 PROC=5` mtx | **Timeout** |
| `IN=5` + `MRDMA_FP16TOFP32_EN` / half buf | **Timeout** |
| Control: `IN=2 OUT=5 PROC=5` + fp16to32 half | **completes** (not a timeout) |

### Verdict

**No usable EW fp32→fp32 (or fp32→fp16) RDMA path found.** Register space allows `IN=5`; submitting it hangs the job (errno 110). Stay on **half-in** (`IN=2` + widen for ALU). OUT=5 still needs host `_fp32_slots_to_half` between dependent stages; gemm accumulate remains a half reduce tree either way. Prefer `ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16` for chain/throughput; keep OUT=5 when single-op f32-store then cast matters.

---

## 2026-08-07 — corrected medium GEMM boundary + compensated DPU EW

All results here use DPU EW only: `DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF`, `ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16`, FP16 inputs and outputs, no CMAC/CNA and no host sum.

### Correction: 18×18 was not a failure

The earlier sweep stopped at N=18 because `maxabs > 5e-3` was treated as failure. The test actually uses
`abs(error) <= atol + rtol*abs(reference)` with `atol=rtol=5e-3`.

| Sequential reduction | Result | Worst tolerance ratio |
|---|---:|---:|
| 18×18 | pass | 0.747 |
| 19×19 | pass | 0.769 |
| 20×20 | pass | 0.815 |
| **21×21** | **fail** (1 element) | **1.096** |

Thus the stock sequential FP16 EW limit for the deterministic sweep data is **20×20**, not 17×17.

### `ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=kahan`

For a fully unrolled ADD tree of MUL terms, the Rockchip lowering can replace the sequential sum with a Kahan-style compensated sum after symbolic simplification. The compensation therefore remains in the emitted program instead of simplifying back to zero. It uses only FP16 DPU EW MUL/ADD operations and represents the running error as another FP16 value.

- EW stages for reduction length K: `K + 7*(K-1) = 8K-7`.
- With the current 64-task software chain cap: N=21 uses 161 stages / 3 ioctls; N=32 uses 249 stages / 4 ioctls.
- Every square size N=21–32 passes the same 5e-3/5e-3 tolerance.
- N=33 currently reaches `RKPLAN_REJECT:unsupported_graph`: the optimizer only fully unrolls arbitrary reductions through K=32. This is now the next compiler ceiling, not a measured DPU accuracy ceiling.
- The Kahan sweep reaches N=32 under the same deterministic inputs.

The shared compensated DAG also required memoizing `lower_ew.visit`; without it, recursively revisiting shared nodes grew exponentially during lowering.

### 1×1 through 32×32 wall profile

Command configuration: `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16 ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=kahan`.
Inputs were realized before timing. `cold` is the first output `realize()` for the shape; `warm` is the median of the next three. Torch reference generation is excluded. All rows passed.

| N | cold ms | warm median ms | ioctls |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 86.461 | 2.026 | 1 |
| 2 | 59.332 | 2.502 | 1 |
| 3 | 36.222 | 2.773 | 1 |
| 4 | 30.944 | 3.051 | 1 |
| 5 | 45.860 | 3.753 | 1 |
| 6 | 37.601 | 4.098 | 1 |
| 7 | 41.426 | 4.439 | 1 |
| 8 | 45.651 | 5.064 | 1 |
| 9 | 50.097 | 5.625 | 1 |
| 10 | 55.050 | 6.269 | 2 |
| 11 | 60.003 | 7.073 | 2 |
| 12 | 65.084 | 7.911 | 2 |
| 13 | 71.397 | 8.643 | 2 |
| 14 | 77.842 | 9.527 | 2 |
| 15 | 84.717 | 10.488 | 2 |
| 16 | 92.066 | 11.719 | 2 |
| 17 | 119.975 | 13.010 | 2 |
| 18 | 314.339 | 14.451 | 3 |
| 19 | 118.008 | 15.753 | 3 |
| 20 | 127.791 | 17.362 | 3 |
| 21 | 138.563 | 19.086 | 3 |
| 22 | 149.768 | 21.145 | 3 |
| 23 | 160.815 | 22.994 | 3 |
| 24 | 174.269 | 25.370 | 3 |
| 25 | 187.882 | 27.323 | 3 |
| 26 | 202.478 | 29.707 | 4 |
| 27 | 218.993 | 32.358 | 4 |
| 28 | 268.390 | 35.380 | 4 |
| 29 | 256.566 | 38.584 | 4 |
| 30 | 274.921 | 41.661 | 4 |
| 31 | 294.521 | 45.336 | 4 |
| **32** | **312.460** | **49.019** | **4** |

The N=18 cold result is an outlier; warm scaling is monotonic. These are end-to-end output-realization wall times, not isolated ioctl hardware time.

---

## 2026-08-07 — EW PC-chain cap raised from 64 to 256

The prior `_EW_CHAIN=64` was a conservative software cap, not a measured hardware limit. The compensated 32×32 GEMM has 249 dependent FP16 EW tasks, making it a direct chain test.

| Software cap | ioctls | Median wall (20 inputs) | Result vs cap 64 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 4 | 50.581 ms | baseline |
| **256** | **1** | **50.915 ms** | bit-exact 20/20 |

Additional single-ioctl dependent ADD-chain probes passed through 256 tasks. The real compensated GEMM also produced identical outputs at caps 64, 128, and 256; random-seed tolerance misses were identical across caps and are numerical, not chain corruption.

Set the OUT=2 `_EW_CHAIN=256`. The 32×32 compensated GEMM now fits in one ioctl. Wall time does not improve materially because emitting/patching 249 register bodies and the EW work dominate this small workload; the change removes submit boundaries rather than arithmetic.

This does **not** apply to OUT=5 mtx512: a 256-task `test_add` chain timed out. Keep `_EW_CHAIN_FP32=64`; the raised cap is specifically for the contiguous FP16-output EW recipe used by compensated GEMM.

---

## 2026-08-07 — compensated EW advanced one-by-one to 37×37

Rockchip's optimizer now permits full unroll through K=64. Both the heuristic threshold and the generic `UNROLL <= 32` guard had to be raised specifically for the ROCKCHIP renderer; before that, N=33 produced three stores and was rejected before submission.

Each size was run separately with a hard 30-second timeout under `ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16 ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=kahan`:

| N | Result | Worst tolerance ratio | ioctls | first-run wall |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 33 | pass | — | 2 | <1 s |
| 34 | pass | 0.829 | 2 | 666 ms |
| 35 | pass | 0.807 | 2 | 875 ms |
| 36 | pass | 0.852 | 2 | 934 ms |
| **37** | **pass** | **0.862** | **2** | **877 ms** |
| 38 | **fail** (1 element) | 1.188 | 2 | 1054 ms |

The Kahan sweep reaches 37×37. N=38 is a numerical limit: Kahan corrects ADD-rounding but cannot recover the product bits lost when each FP16×FP16 result is stored as FP16.

### N=37 merged into one PC chain

Kahan N=37 emits `8*37-7 = 289` dependent FP16 EW tasks, which crossed the previous 256-task cap. Raising the OUT=2 cap to 512 was bit-exact against cap 256 for 10/10 inputs:

| FP16 chain cap | ioctls | warm median wall |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 | 2 | 70.564 ms |
| **512** | **1** | **70.013 ms** |

Set `_EW_CHAIN=512` for OUT=2. OUT=5 mtx512 remains separately capped at 64.

---

## 2026-08-07 — FP16 TwoProduct EW reaches 64×64

Config: `ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16 ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`. DPU EW only, no CMAC/CNA and no host arithmetic.

Kahan cannot recover the low product bits after FP16 store. TwoProduct uses a Dekker split (`splitter=65`) to represent every FP16×FP16 product as two FP16 values: rounded product plus exact-ish residual. A general TwoSum then accumulates all product highs followed by residuals in a two-half `(high, low)` accumulator. The graph is constructed after symbolic simplification so the error terms remain as physical EW MUL/ADD tasks.

The mixed TwoProduct graph timed out with 512 tasks in one chain but passes with 256, so runtime uses `_EW_CHAIN_TWOPRODUCT=256` while ordinary OUT=2 Kahan retains 512.

Every size was run separately with a hard 30-second timeout. All N=38 through N=64 passed:

| N | ratio | ioctls | first-run wall ms | N | ratio | ioctls | first-run wall ms |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 38 | 0.117 | 7 | 2192 | 52 | 0.126 | 9 | 5608 |
| 39 | 0.115 | 7 | 2576 | 53 | 0.127 | 10 | 5853 |
| 40 | 0.093 | 7 | 2738 | 54 | 0.173 | 10 | 6194 |
| 41 | 0.169 | 8 | 3464 | 55 | 0.148 | 10 | 6502 |
| 42 | 0.106 | 8 | 3125 | 56 | 0.145 | 10 | 6846 |
| 43 | 0.074 | 8 | 3336 | 57 | 0.152 | 10 | 7182 |
| 44 | 0.117 | 8 | 3549 | 58 | 0.136 | 10 | 7717 |
| 45 | 0.120 | 8 | 3895 | 59 | 0.180 | 11 | 7980 |
| 46 | 0.078 | 8 | 4005 | 60 | 0.158 | 11 | 8350 |
| 47 | 0.149 | 9 | 4215 | 61 | 0.134 | 11 | 8849 |
| 48 | 0.105 | 9 | 4494 | 62 | 0.155 | 11 | 9554 |
| 49 | 0.160 | 9 | 4854 | 63 | 0.144 | 11 | 9888 |
| 50 | 0.151 | 9 | 5113 | **64** | **0.145** | **11** | **10106** |
| 51 | 0.150 | 9 | 5281 | | | | |

The authoritative GEMM milestone is now `test_gemm_fp16` at 64×64. It passes in TwoProduct mode below the 30-second wall cap with substantial numerical margin. The redundant incremental `test_medium_gemm` was removed; its one-by-one census remains documented above.

### `test_gemm_fp16` cold wall decomposition

Profile config matches the passing test: `DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_OUT=fp16 ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`. The named pytest passes in **18.62 s** with `-n12`; a directly instrumented cold realization takes **7.207 s**, so approximately **11.4 s** is pytest/xdist worker startup and imports.

| Cold realization component | Wall | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| render + `lower_ew` | 6293 ms | 87.3% |
| program `__call__` | 404 ms | 5.6% |
| scheduler/program setup outside those regions | 509 ms | 7.1% |
| **output `realize()`** | **7207 ms** | **100%** |

The TwoProduct DAG itself is cheap to construct (17.9 ms). Most of the 6.24 s inside `lower_ew` is plan bookkeeping over the 2806-op graph: dependency/use counting, scratch assignment, and gather-offset construction. This is the dominant next optimization target, not ioctl count.

Program-call decomposition:

| Runtime component | Wall |
|---|---:|
| gather/setup/final-output work outside EW runner | 276.4 ms |
| EW runner total | 128.1 ms |
| ├ command emit (2806 bodies) | 40.6 ms |
| ├ relocation patch | 17.9 ms |
| ├ submit CPU construction | 29.1 ms |
| ├ 11 blocking ioctls | 14.0 ms |
| └ loop/other | 26.5 ms |

Other excluded measurements: input Tensor construction 3.6 ms, Torch reference 0.9 ms, and final `numpy()` copyout 2.7 ms.

### Cold-lowering optimization

The 7.207 s direct cold realization was Python compiler overhead rather than DPU execution. `lower_ew` calculated each logical input gather four times because repeated leaf UOps were only deduplicated after offset expansion, and its dependency-use count scanned the whole graph once per node.

Caching lowered leaf operands and replacing the quadratic use-count comprehension with one linear edge walk preserves the output (worst tolerance ratio remains 0.145) and changes the cold profile as follows:

| Component | Before | After | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| direct output `realize()` | 7.207 s | 2.732 s | 2.64× faster |
| `lower_ew` | 6.306 s | 1.762 s | 3.58× faster |
| gather-offset construction | 4.170 s / 512 calls | 1.054 s / 128 calls | four duplicate calls removed |
| other lowering work | 2.119 s | 0.691 s | 3.07× faster |
| named pytest (`-n12`) | 18.62 s | 14.39 s | 4.23 s less wall time |

`test_gemm_fp16` still passes under its hard 30-second timeout. The remaining roughly 1.05 s in gather-offset construction is now the largest measured lowering component.

---

## 2026-08-07 — FP16-only cleanup and CPU-execution audit

The Rockchip backend now exposes only the hardware path under test: contiguous FP16 DPU EW output. The legacy mtx512 `OUT=5` path was removed because it converted FP32 results back to FP16 on the host after every operation. FP32 argument casting, host pack/unpack helpers, and the intermediate-result copyout path were removed with it.

`sz.py` result for executable Rockchip code:

| File | Before | After | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `tinygrad/renderer/rockchip.py` | 438 | 325 | 113 |
| `tinygrad/runtime/ops_rockchip.py` | 241 | 131 | 110 |
| **combined** | **679** | **456** | **223 (32.8%)** |

Comments and docstrings were retained because `sz.py` does not count them. Repository total lines fell from 25,730 to 25,507.

### Execution audit

- There is no CMAC/CNA path.
- There is no NumPy import, FP32 temporary, `astype`, host sum, or host ADD/MUL in the Rockchip renderer/runtime.
- Contiguous FP16 arguments are bound directly as DPU sources; they are no longer copied into scratch.
- The final DPU EW operation writes directly to the destination argument; there is no host result copy.
- Constants and constant-only fills are materialized as FP16 bytes on the host. This is data initialization, not tensor arithmetic.
- GEMM still needs host gather/layout preparation because DPU EW only consumes contiguous pairwise vectors and cannot apply tinygrad's arbitrary load indexes. Masked padding is represented by `-1` gather entries and zero-filled. Every GEMM MUL/ADD, including TwoProduct residual recovery, executes on DPU EW.
- The safe PC-chain limit is stored in the compiled image (512 for ordinary/Kahan graphs and 256 for mixed TwoProduct graphs), removing the previous runtime dependence on the current environment variable.
- RKImage version validation is now strict, and malformed/nonzero masked-load defaults are rejected instead of silently miscomputed.

This is closer to other tinygrad hardware backends: allocator methods move buffers, `Program.__call__` binds arguments/builds commands/submits, and the device performs tensor arithmetic. Unlike general GPU/DSP backends, Rockchip still preprocesses indexed operands on the host and uses blocking ioctls rather than an asynchronous hardware queue, so it remains a focused DPU-EW capability harness rather than a general backend.

Verification after cleanup:

- `test_gemm_fp16`: **1 passed in 13.30 s** with `-n12` and a hard 30 s timeout.
- Direct 64×64 cold realization: **1.975 s**, 11 ioctls, within the 5e-3/5e-3 tolerance.
- Non-slow Rockchip census: **18 passed, 5 skipped in 12.16 s**. Four skips are slow tests; `test_mul_naninf` records that RK3588 FP16 DPU EW MUL returns NaN for infinity operands rather than hiding it with a CPU fallback.
- Full `ruff check .`: pass.
- Full `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 files).

## 2026-08-07 — 256×256 affine-gather profile and optimization

With a 180-second cap, Rockchip's FP16-tolerance `test_big_gemm` first passed in 110.55 s. The original `TestOps.test_big_gemm` completed in 136.96 s but missed its stricter 1e-4/1e-3 tolerance on 35 of 65,536 elements (maximum absolute difference 0.000977).

The initial direct cold profile took 108.738 s and submitted 88 ioctls:

| Component | Before | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| render/lower | 86.511 s | 79.6% |
| compile-time gather-offset expansion | 83.235 s | 76.5% |
| runtime host gather/layout | 13.551 s | 12.5% |
| other scheduler/program setup | 7.384 s | 6.8% |
| DPU EW runner | 1.292 s | 1.2% |
| 88 blocking ioctls | 0.614 s | 0.6% |

The kernel has 11,254 logical EW operations over 65,536 output elements. The tested 64,000-element tile cap splits every operation in two, producing 22,508 DPU tasks. At the TwoProduct 256-task chain cap this is `ceil(22508/256) = 88` submits.

Raising the tile cap is unsafe. A 65,536-element one-ioctl ADD (`WIDTH=8191`) completed with 99.8% wrong values, while 65,528 (`WIDTH=8190`) timed out in the ioctl. The NPU was reset after the probe and `_MAX_EW_ELEMS_FP16` remains 64,000.

Large unmasked gathers are now encoded as a base plus affine `(destination divisor, range limit, source stride)` axes rather than a complete offset tuple. Masked/padded operations keep the general offset fallback. Runtime materializes both forms with bulk uint16 indexing; this performs only layout movement and integer address generation on the host, while every floating-point MUL/ADD remains on DPU EW.

After the change:

| Component | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| direct cold realization | 108.738 s | **4.908 s** |
| render/lower | 86.511 s | **0.229 s** |
| gather-plan construction | 83.235 s | **0.005 s** |
| runtime host gather/layout | 13.551 s | **1.664 s** |
| serialized RKImage | 128 MiB of raw offsets | **475,838 bytes** |
| DPU tasks / ioctls | 22,508 / 88 | **22,508 / 88** |

The named Rockchip `test_big_gemm` now passes in 16.93 s including fresh pytest/xdist startup. The non-slow Rockchip census remains green (18 passed, 5 skipped), and full Ruff/mypy pass.

## 2026-08-07 — convolution census begins with 1x1

The generic `TestOps.test_simple_conv2d_1x1` case, input `(1,4,9,9)` and weight `(4,4,1,1)`, passes on Rockchip with FP16 input and DPU EW-only execution. It is now mirrored in `test/backend/test_rockchip.py` so the backend census uses the same `5e-3/5e-3` tolerance as `test_gemm_fp16` and asserts the hardware submit count.

Direct cold realization took **0.193 s**, used **1 ioctl submit**, and had maximum absolute error **1.52588e-05** against the Torch FP16 reference. The generic pytest case passed in **11.34 s** including fresh xdist worker startup.

The next representative 3x3 sweep also passes:

| Case | Output | Cold realization | Ioctl submits | Maximum absolute error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| unpadded | `(1,4,7,7)` | 0.449 s | 7 | 0.00195312 |
| batch 2 | `(2,4,7,7)` | 0.293 s | 7 | 0 |
| padding 1 | `(1,4,9,9)` | 0.491 s | 7 | 1.52588e-05 |
| stride 2 | `(1,4,4,4)` | 0.295 s | 7 | 0 |
| depthwise, 4 groups | `(1,4,7,7)` | 0.102 s | 2 | 0 |

These cases remain FP16-input, DPU EW-only tests. Torch is used only to construct the test oracle; backend execution performs no host floating-point arithmetic.

The six-test convolution subset passes in **12.21 s** and the complete Rockchip census passes in **18.08 s** (`28 passed, 1 skipped`), both with `-n12` and a hard 30-second timeout. Full Ruff and mypy checks pass.

### Convolution reduction width and layout expansion

The convolution census now also covers both sides of K=64, the larger M4 cases from `test_ops`, grouped convolution, and dilation:

- 3x3 with 7 input channels (K=63): 11 submits, 0.629 s direct cold realization.
- 3x3 with 8 input channels (K=72): 13 submits, 0.676 s; this proves 64 reduction terms is not the current backend limit.
- 3x3 with 16 input/output channels (K=144): 25 submits, 1.195 s.
- 1x1 with 16 input/output channels at 32x32: 3 submits, 0.169 s.
- Two-group 3x3: 7 submits, 0.471 s.
- Dilated 3x3: 7 submits, 0.279 s.

All twelve Rockchip convolution tests pass in **13.42 s**. The complete backend census is now **34 passed, 1 skipped in 17.58 s**, still under the hard 30-second timeout.

### Convolution index and masked-layout fixes

Rockchip now evaluates `CDIV`, `CMOD`, `FLOORDIV`, and `FLOORMOD` while constructing integer gather indices. This is host address/layout calculation only; no floating-point operation moved off DPU EW. Output-padded transposed convolution no longer rejects its index expression and passes the allowed FP16 tolerance (1 submit, 1.806 s direct cold realization).

The optimizer no longer upcasts masked Rockchip axes into several scalar stores, preserving the renderer's single contiguous-store contract. Asymmetric 1D and 2D padding and padded 3D convolution now pass their original `test_ops` checks. A zero-select `WHERE` around a masked load is folded into that load's gather gate, so simple explicit padding also passes without CPU floating-point execution. The asymmetric 2D backend census case realizes in 0.469 s with 1 submit and exact output in the measured probe.

### Complete convolution census and native ReLU

The Rockchip census now mirrors every one of the 48 `test*conv*` methods from `test/backend/test_ops.py` and applies exactly the `test_gemm_fp16` ceiling (`atol=5e-3`, `rtol=5e-3`, including gradient tolerances). It stays synchronized with future convolution additions while the existing explicit Rockchip cases continue to assert exact ioctl-submit counts.

Native DPU ReLU is emitted by leaving `EW_RELU_BYPASS` clear after an EW pass-through. Convolution ADD trees may include a bias term, and the TwoProduct reduction now carries a three-half expansion so wider Conv2D reductions and nested bias/ReLU graphs remain within the FP16 contract. The resulting submit counts are recorded in the explicit backend tests rather than hidden behind a CPU path.

The formerly opaque EW words are now composed from the RK3588 register fields named by the hardware reference: FP16 data mode and element size, ALU algorithm, ReLU/LUT bypass, operand source/conversion, and operation type. These definitions reproduce the verified words exactly:

| Operation | `DPU_EW_CFG` |
|---|---:|
| ADD | `0x108202c0` |
| MUL | `0x108003c4` |
| native ReLU | `0x108000c0` |

Two cases use an FP32-accumulated Torch golden cast back to FP16: biased ConvTranspose2D and ConvTranspose3D. PyTorch CPU's FP16 reduction is less accurate for these cases; for example, the biased 2D outlier is `-0.60840` from CPU FP16 versus an exact FP16-input sum of `-0.61804`, while DPU EW returns `-0.61816`. Against the FP32 golden, the complete biased case has maximum absolute error `0.001953`, and ConvTranspose3D has zero tolerance violations with maximum absolute error `0.015625`. Torch remains test-oracle code only.

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- All mirrored convolution cases: **42 passed, 6 intentionally skipped, 37 subtests passed in 42.51 s**.
- Complete `test/backend/test_rockchip.py`: **78 passed, 7 skipped, 37 subtests passed in 51.06 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- No CMAC/CNA execution, host floating-point fallback, or relaxed tolerance was added. Host work remains integer gather/layout preparation; all convolution MUL/ADD/ReLU arithmetic executes through DPU EW with FP16 buffers.

---

## 2026-08-07 — DPU EW binary MAX and FP16 MaxPool2D census

The Rockchip renderer now distinguishes the two uses of the EW MAX datapath. Binary MAX sets `EW_RELU_BYPASS`, producing the register word `0x108002c0` verified by `~/rk3588/examples/elementwise.py` and the upstream research renderer. Native unary ReLU keeps that bypass clear and remains `0x108000c0`. Both words are assembled from named RK3588 register fields rather than embedded hex literals.

Pooling remains a DPU-EW limit experiment. The upstream pooling examples often switch to PPU or CMAC for layout/reformat and large reductions; none of those paths were imported. MaxPool windows are expanded into binary FP16 EW MAX operations, and the existing host gather performs integer address/layout preparation only.

Padded pooling required preserving the FP16 fill value in gather metadata. RKImage v14 stores the raw 16-bit fill pattern, allowing masked lanes to be initialized to `-inf` without host floating-point tensor arithmetic. The rewrite only moves a `WHERE` mask into a load when it proves that the outer condition implies the load condition, including commuted `AND` expressions. MAX-tree masks are folded only when every leaf has the same or exact complementary condition. This covers symmetric padding, asymmetric padding, and ceil-mode edge windows without a general unsafe `WHERE` rewrite.

Every numeric FP16 `test_max_pool2d*` method from `test/backend/test_ops.py` now passes at exactly the `test_gemm_fp16` tolerance ceiling (`atol=rtol=grad_atol=grad_rtol=5e-3`):

- **11 methods passed, 33 subtests passed** in 14.24 s on the NPU.
- `test_max_pool2d_padding_int` is explicitly skipped because Rockchip accepts FP16 inputs only.
- `test_max_pool2d_return_indices` is explicitly skipped because DPU EW does not produce the required integer index tensor.
- A direct FP16 binary-maximum regression and a MaxPool submit-count regression were added to `test/backend/test_rockchip.py`.

Direct cold output-realization profiles all used one `DRM_IOCTL_RKNPU_SUBMIT`:

| Case | Wall time | Submits | Maximum absolute error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `(1,1,2,3)`, 2x2 | 0.110 s | 1 | 0 |
| `(3,2,17,14)`, 5x5 stride 1 | 0.141 s | 1 | 0 |
| `(4,2,111,28)`, asymmetric-padded 5x5 | 0.474 s | 1 | 0 |

Complete verification after the change:

- `test/backend/test_rockchip.py`: **91 passed, 9 skipped, 70 subtests passed in 44.94 s** with `-n12`.
- Full Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 445 executable lines, runtime 142; comments and docstrings retained.
- CPU-execution audit: runtime NumPy use is limited to `uint16` buffer views and integer gather-index construction. There is no host MAX, ADD, MUL, reduction, FP32 conversion, CMAC, or CNA path.

AvgPool2D is the next pooling boundary. Five initial cases already execute, while the remaining forms expose FP32 `MUL/CAST` lowering and, for `count_include_pad=False`, dynamic reciprocal/mask expressions. Those are separate ADD/MUL lowering work and were not hidden by a CPU fallback in this MAX milestone.

---

## 2026-08-07 — FP16 AvgPool through DPU EW, including valid-count divisors

All `test_avg_pool*` cases from `test/backend/test_ops.py` now run through the FP16 DPU EW backend. No PPU, CMAC, CNA, or CPU tensor fallback was added. The PPU average-pooling recipes in `~/rk3588` and `rockchip-upstream-research` were used only to confirm hardware semantics; this branch deliberately continues to test the DPU EW ADD/MUL limit.

Fixed-divisor AvgPool lowers the FP32-shaped tinygrad epilogue to FP16 ADD/MUL and folds compile-time casts of scalar constants. The reduction sum and final scale multiply execute on DPU EW. Across the unpadded and padded 2D sweep, all 14 kernel/padding combinations used one ioctl and the largest measured absolute error was `0.0009765625`, below the unchanged `5e-3/5e-3` FP16 tolerance ceiling.

`count_include_pad=False` requires a divisor that varies at edges. This is still not host tensor arithmetic: the divisor depends only on static output geometry, never on input values. The compiler evaluates the geometry-only RANGE/WHERE expression and stores its raw FP16 reciprocal bits in RKImage v15. At program launch, the runtime copies those immutable `uint16` constants into scratch. It performs no floating-point reciprocal, sum, multiply, mean, or conversion. Every input-dependent ADD and MUL is submitted to DPU EW. A dedicated regression asserts that the padded valid-count path performs one NPU ioctl.

Average pooling also exposed the previous 64-term compiler unroll ceiling. Rockchip now permits scaled ADD reductions through 512 terms, while GEMM/convolution and other reductions keep their proven 64-term heuristic bound. This enables the 308-term global 11x28 AvgPool and the 512-term AvgPool3D case without changing convolution lowering. The reciprocal-leaf detector is restricted to static `RECIPROCAL` roots, avoiding a quadratic graph walk in convolution compilation.

Representative direct cold profiles, excluding Torch reference generation:

| Case | Wall time | Submits | Maximum absolute error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 3x3 fixed divisor, `(32,2,11,28)` | 0.217 s | 1 | 0.0004883 |
| 3x3 valid-count padding, `(32,2,11,28)` | 0.473 s | 1 | 0.0004883 |
| global 11x28, `(32,2,11,28)` | 1.032 s | 2 | 0.0003052 |
| AvgPool3D 8x8x8, `(1,1,16,16,16)` | 7.981 s | 3 | 0.0003357 |

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- AvgPool census: **10 passed, 26 subtests passed in 20.58 s**.
- Convolution regression census after the unroll change: **42 passed, 6 skipped, 37 subtests passed in 45.66 s**.
- Complete Rockchip census: **102 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 60.12 s**.
- Full Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 498 executable lines, runtime 144; comments and docstrings retained.
- Runtime CPU audit: NumPy is used only for raw `uint16` views and integer indexing/copies. There is no host floating-point arithmetic or conversion.

PyTorch CPU does not implement FP16 AvgPool3D, so that one test constructs its oracle in FP32 and casts the oracle to FP16. This affects test-reference generation only; Rockchip execution remains FP16 DPU EW.

---

## 2026-08-08 — First post-518 milestone: nearest interpolation through DPU EW

Development restarted from the known-good `518487a5c24c7390e5b40cdb85f91d6e158c4383` baseline. The first newly admitted upstream method is `TestOps.test_interpolate_nearest`, covering six 1D, 2D, and 3D resize shapes. It passes at the unchanged `test_gemm_fp16` tolerance ceiling (`atol=rtol=grad_atol=grad_rtol=5e-3`). A direct `(2,3,13) -> (2,3,9)` regression additionally asserts exactly one NPU ioctl.

Nearest interpolation is a gather, but the output is not accepted as a host-produced result. Rockchip prepares only the static integer gather offsets and mask, then sends the gathered FP16 values through a DPU EW `ADD 0` pass-through stage. Typed compile-time evaluation now preserves integer, boolean, FP16, and FP32 cast semantics in layout expressions. No input-dependent floating-point arithmetic, CMAC, CNA, PPU, or CPU numeric fallback was added.

Focused verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- Direct submit-count regression: **1 passed in 2.83 s**, exactly 1 ioctl.
- Full upstream `test_interpolate_nearest`: **1 passed in 3.96 s**, covering all six resize shapes.
- Gather regression group (nearest, MaxPool, AvgPool, output-padded ConvTranspose2D): **4 passed in 8.13 s**.
- Complete Rockchip census, run as 113 separate sequential pytest processes to limit retained program buffers: **104 passed, 9 intentionally skipped**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 501 executable lines, runtime 144; comments and docstrings retained.

The current `518` runtime still requests contiguous GEM buffers against an 8 MiB CMA pool. Several large existing cases logged recoverable CMA allocation failures even with one pytest node per process, although this run produced no RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or kernel oops. Fixing this allocation policy safely is the next prerequisite before broadening the interpolation census.

---

## 2026-08-08 — Page-backed RKNPU buffers remove the 8 MiB CMA limit

All Rockchip GEM objects now use the allocation policy captured from the vendor RKNN runtime: ordinary data, scratch, and command buffers use `NON_CONTIGUOUS|CACHEABLE|IOMMU_LIMIT_IOVA_ALIGNMENT` (`0x403`), while task buffers additionally use `KERNEL_MAPPING` (`0x40b`). This selects the driver's page-backed IOMMU allocation path directly instead of first exhausting the board's 8 MiB CMA pool and entering the driver's broken contiguous-to-noncontiguous fallback.

Cacheable mappings require explicit ownership transfer. Copy-in, copy-out, command/task construction, constants, gathers, and fills now issue the corresponding `MEM_SYNC` ioctl. Before each program, every argument is synchronized from and then back to the device, matching the vendor behavior. A narrower gather-only synchronization experiment produced stale zero cache lines in `test_add3` after allocator reuse, so the broader handoff is required for correctness on this driver.

Allocation is transactional: a failed create is reported as `MemoryError`, while a failed map/mmap destroys the newly created GEM before propagating the allocation failure. Program-owned scratch and command/task lifetime, PC-chain construction, and the passing `518` submission path remain unchanged.

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- Tiny ADD health probe: **1 passed in 2.83 s**, exactly 1 ioctl.
- Large GEMM + nearest gather + chained ADD: **3 passed in 6.89 s**.
- Complete monolithic Rockchip census: **104 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 169.07 s**.
- Post-coherency regression (large GEMM, nearest, chained ADD, output-padded ConvTranspose2D): **4 passed in 11.38 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 501 executable lines, runtime 165; comments and docstrings retained.

Across the complete monolithic run, `CmaFree` stayed at 6144 KiB and the kernel logged no CMA allocation failure, RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or oops. The allocator safety prerequisite is therefore cleared. The next performance target is the fresh-process `test_simple_conv_transpose3d` node, previously measured at 65.21 s.

---

## 2026-08-08 — Vectorized static gather planning removes ConvTranspose3D compile stall

`TestRockchipConvOps.test_simple_conv_transpose3d` previously passed but took **65.21 s** in a fresh pytest process. `DEBUG=2` separated the device work from compilation: scheduling took 182.05 ms, two uploads took 0.25 ms total, and the DPU program took 271.54 ms. Almost the entire remaining minute was Rockchip renderer CPU time.

A CPU profile measured 112.88 s under profiling in `lower_ew`. The 108 masked convolution gathers called the scalar index interpreter 58.6 million times; `_eval_expr` consumed 108.43 s. Per-output expression memoization reduced the ordinary test from 65.21 s to 45.16 s, confirming repeated static-index evaluation as the cause but not removing enough Python iteration.

Rockchip now evaluates complete static gather-index vectors with NumPy. RANGE values, typed casts, comparisons, masks, integer division/modulo, and affine output addresses are computed as vectorized layout metadata. This remains host integer address preparation only: no input-dependent FP16 value, convolution product, sum, or activation is computed on CPU. The existing runtime gather copies FP16 bit patterns according to those offsets, and all numeric convolution work still runs through DPU EW.

Results after vectorization:

- ConvTranspose3D pytest time: **6.32 s** (down from 65.21 s, 10.3x faster).
- Shell wall time including imports: **8.604 s**.
- Scheduling: 170.26 ms; NPU program: 274.85 ms.
- Complete monolithic Rockchip census: **104 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 67.19 s** (down from 169.07 s after cache-sync enablement).
- Focused nearest/AvgPool/ConvTranspose regressions: **4 passed in 7.38 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 552 executable lines, runtime 165; comments and docstrings retained.

The complete run left `CmaFree` at 6144 KiB and produced no CMA failure, RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or kernel oops. Every individual Rockchip node is again below 30 seconds.

---

## 2026-08-08 — `test_interpolate_nearest_exact`

The next upstream method was added individually to the Rockchip census. `TestOps.test_interpolate_nearest_exact` reuses the six 1D, 2D, and 3D shapes from nearest interpolation with PyTorch's `nearest-exact` coordinate rule. All static index casts and masks are prepared by the vectorized Rockchip gather planner, and every FP16 result passes through DPU EW before reaching the output.

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- Focused upstream method: **1 passed in 3.41 s**; shell wall time 5.574 s.
- Complete Rockchip census: **105 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 67.96 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 552 executable lines, runtime 165.

The complete run left `CmaFree` at 6144 KiB and produced no CMA failure, RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or kernel oops. The next upstream interpolation case is `test_interpolate_linear`.

---

## 2026-08-08 — `test_interpolate_linear`

The upstream 1D linear interpolation method now passes both resize directions, `(2,3,52) -> (2,3,29)` and `(2,3,29) -> (2,3,52)`, at the unchanged FP16 tolerance. A direct regression asserts that the first direction uses exactly one ioctl.

Interpolation coordinates and fractional weights depend only on shape. Rockchip retains those FP32 cast/WHERE/TRUNC expressions as static geometry and uploads their final FP16 bit patterns. It no longer rewrites geometry-only FP32 ADD/MUL into dynamic nodes. The gathered low/high FP16 input values and every input-dependent lerp MUL/ADD execute through DPU EW; there is no CPU interpolation or input-dependent arithmetic.

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- Focused direct and upstream methods: **2 passed in 3.06 s**; direct case exactly 1 ioctl.
- Complete Rockchip census: **107 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 101.45 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 553 executable lines, runtime 165.

The complete run left `CmaFree` at 6144 KiB and produced no CMA failure, RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or kernel oops. The next upstream interpolation case is `test_interpolate_linear_corners_aligned`.

---

## 2026-08-08 — `test_interpolate_linear_corners_aligned`

The second upstream 1D linear interpolation method passes both resize directions with `align_corners=True`. This changes only the static coordinate/weight formula; gathered FP16 values and lerp arithmetic continue through the already verified DPU EW path.

- Focused upstream method: **1 passed in 3.03 s**.
- Complete admitted interpolation group: **4 passed in 4.38 s**.
- Rockchip collection: 117 nodes (the previous full census was 107 passed / 9 skipped; this new node passed focused validation).
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- No new kernel error signature.

The next upstream interpolation case is `test_interpolate_bilinear`.

---

## 2026-08-08 — `test_interpolate_bilinear` without shared-core changes

The upstream bilinear method now passes all three 2D resize pairs. A direct `(2,3,12,20) -> (2,3,9,31)` regression asserts exactly two ioctls, one DPU EW program per separable axis.

Tinygrad's generic interpolation keeps the first-axis result in an internal FP32-sized buffer. Rockchip still advertises only FP16 as a supported dtype and performs no FP32 arithmetic or conversion. For Rockchip programs, that oversized internal buffer now carries a contiguous FP16 payload produced by the first DPU pass; the second Rockchip pass reads the same FP16 payload. This preserves the device's actual FP16 storage/arithmetic contract without changing `tinygrad/mixin/op.py` or any other shared core file.

The host continues to prepare static integer gathers and geometry-only FP16 weights. Every input-dependent low/high interpolation MUL/ADD executes on DPU EW. No CPU interpolation, CMAC, CNA, or PPU path was added.

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- Focused direct and upstream methods: **2 passed in 4.29 s**; direct case exactly 2 ioctls.
- Complete Rockchip census: **110 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 101.59 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 553 executable lines, runtime 165.

The complete run left `CmaFree` at 6144 KiB and produced no CMA failure, RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or kernel oops. The next upstream interpolation case is `test_interpolate_bilinear_corners_aligned`.

---

## 2026-08-08 — `test_interpolate_bilinear_corners_aligned`

The aligned-corners bilinear method passes all three upstream 2D resize pairs through the same two-pass FP16 DPU EW path.

- Focused upstream method: **1 passed in 4.04 s**.
- Complete admitted interpolation group: **6 passed in 6.92 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- No new kernel error signature.

The next upstream interpolation case is `test_interpolate_trilinear`.

---

## 2026-08-08 — `test_interpolate_trilinear`

The upstream trilinear method passes `(2,3,5,2,8) -> (2,3,3,6,4)`. A smaller direct regression confirms exactly three ioctls, one FP16 DPU EW lerp pass for each spatial axis. Both internal FP32-sized separable buffers carry only contiguous FP16 NPU-produced payloads.

- Focused direct and upstream methods: **2 passed in 3.61 s**; direct case exactly 3 ioctls.
- Complete admitted interpolation methods plus four submit-count regressions: **11 passed in 7.94 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- No new kernel error signature.

The final floating-point interpolation method is `test_interpolate_trilinear_corners_aligned`.

---

## 2026-08-08 — Complete FP16 interpolation census

`test_interpolate_trilinear_corners_aligned` passes its upstream 3D resize case, completing all eight floating-point `test_interpolate*` methods from `TestOps`: nearest, nearest-exact, 1D linear, aligned 1D linear, bilinear, aligned bilinear, trilinear, and aligned trilinear.

All nearest values and linear low/high operands are gathered as FP16 bit patterns. Static geometry supplies only indices and FP16 weights. Input-dependent interpolation arithmetic executes on DPU EW in one, two, or three passes according to spatial rank. Rockchip remains FP16-only, performs no CPU interpolation, and changes no shared tinygrad core file.

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- Focused aligned-trilinear method: **1 passed in 3.24 s**.
- Complete Rockchip census: **114 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 104.06 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 553 executable lines, runtime 165.

The complete run left `CmaFree` at 6144 KiB and produced no CMA failure, RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or kernel oops. The floating-point interpolation group is complete; uint8 interpolation remains outside the FP16 input contract.

## 2026-08-08 — `test_full_like` and `test_full`: typed raw constant fill

The remaining `TestOps` census is now advancing in source order. `test_full_like` passes its explicit FP32 and int32 outputs, and `test_full` passes its integer output. These require no numeric NPU operation: each tensor is a compile-time scalar repeated into storage.

RKImage v16 records the fill element width in the previously reserved fill byte. The compiler serializes the scalar using the destination dtype's exact byte format, and the runtime copies those immutable bytes across the destination before synchronizing the cacheable buffer to the device. Dynamic Rockchip arithmetic remains FP16-only; this is raw constant initialization, not CPU input-dependent arithmetic or FP32 emulation.

Verification with `FORWARD_ONLY=1 DEFAULT_FLOAT=HALF DEV=ROCKCHIP ROCKCHIP_EW_REDUCE=twoproduct`:

- `test_full_like`: **1 passed in 2.66 s**.
- `test_full`: **1 passed in 2.61 s**.
- Complete Rockchip census: **116 passed, 9 skipped, 96 subtests passed in 109.58 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- `sz.py`: renderer 556 executable lines, runtime 165.

The complete run left `CmaFree` at 6144 KiB and produced no CMA failure, RKNPU timeout, invalid IRQ, IOMMU fault, or kernel oops. The next source-order methods are the negative-dimension exception tests.

## 2026-08-08 — Negative-dimension validation methods

Four source-order `TestOps` methods were admitted and run individually: `test_negative_dims`, `test_negative_dims_full`, `test_negative_dims_eye`, and `test_negative_dims_kaiming`. Every invalid shape raises before device allocation or submission.

- Individual times: 2.59 s, 2.58 s, 2.57 s, and 2.51 s.
- Incremental creation/validation group: **6 passed in 2.82 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).

The next source-order method is `test_zeros`.

## 2026-08-08 — Creation methods through `test_eye`

Six more source-order methods were admitted and run individually: `test_zeros`, `test_zeros_like`, `test_empty_0`, `test_ones`, `test_ones_like`, and `test_eye`. Uniform values use typed raw constant fill. `test_empty_0` folds to a constant NaN fill. Eye matrices are geometry-only FP16 static vectors followed by DPU EW pass-through, not CPU-generated numeric outputs.

- Individual methods: all pass in 2.66–3.03 s.
- Complete incremental creation/validation group: **12 passed in 3.15 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- No new kernel error signature.

The next source-order method is `test_split`.

## 2026-08-08 — Movement and range construction through `test_linspace`

Eight more source-order methods were admitted and run individually: `test_split`, `test_chunk`, `test_unfold`, `test_meshgrid`, `test_arange`, `test_arange_big`, `test_arange_4096`, and `test_linspace`.

Split/chunk remain views where possible; materialized FP16 movement uses the existing gather plus DPU pass-through path. Range/linspace values depend only on their scalar construction arguments and are materialized as static typed data. This includes FP16, int8, int32, and int64 output checks and does not introduce input-dependent CPU arithmetic.

- Individual method times: 2.92–5.72 s.
- Complete incremental source-order group: **20 passed in 4.94 s**.
- Ruff: pass.
- `mypy tinygrad/`: pass (216 source files).
- No new kernel error signature.

The next source-order method is `test_sum_fake`.
