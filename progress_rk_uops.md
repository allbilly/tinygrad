# Rockchip UOp executor progress

## Architecture rules

- UOps are the semantic program. Do not add `_lower_<tensor operation>()` handlers.
- `RKValue` is the physical ABI: argument/scratch location, semantic dtype, lane count, and canonical layout.
- One UOp may emit several `RKEWOp` stages, but stages remain in one `RKImage`/PC chain where the runtime permits.
- Memory materialization is separate from numeric semantics. Host fallbacks may calculate addresses and copy raw data only.
- The old lowering catalog is a temporary correctness oracle and is used only when the generic executor declines a program.

## Milestones

### 1. Typed elementwise executor — complete

- Added canonical `RKLayout` and `RKValue` types.
- Added `RKContext`, with typed values, scratch ownership, constants, static vectors, and static gathers.
- Added true-arity handlers for FP16 and INT16 arithmetic, unary negation/reciprocal, FP16 comparisons, boolean mask algebra, and ternary `WHERE`.
- Added explicit bool-mask conversion at the output boundary.
- Routed the generic executor ahead of the legacy catalog while retaining safe fallback for unsupported graphs.
- Added host-independent unit coverage for the ABI, dependency lowering, ternary arity, static gathers, bool output conversion, and native INT16 layout.

Verification:

- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest test/unit/test_rockchip_uops.py -x -q -n12`: 9 passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check tinygrad/renderer/rockchip.py test/unit/test_rockchip_uops.py`: pass.
- `.venv/bin/python -m mypy tinygrad/renderer/rockchip.py`: pass.

### 2. Math UOp recipes — complete

- Moved SQRT, EXP2, LOG2, and SIN recipe ownership into the generic executor.
- Each semantic math UOp now expands directly to its existing DPU arithmetic recipe and physical stages.
- Added one generic recipe test covering all four math UOps.

### 3. Structural RANGE/reduction execution — complete

- Added one static structural interpreter for `REDUCE`/`RANGE` with ADD, MAX, and MUL.
- Added the symmetric local LOAD/STORE accumulator interpreter for the same operators.
- Structural execution produces ordinary semantic UOps and reuses `RKContext`; it does not recover a tensor operation name.
- Added coverage for direct reductions and mutable local accumulators across all three operators.

### 4. Symmetric host address materialization — pending

- Add explicit `HOST_ADDRESS` image/runtime records for direct dynamic gather and scatter.
- Keep numeric and reduction semantics forbidden on the host.

### 5. Legacy deletion census — pending

- Run the Rockchip census and delete operation-specific lowerers replaced by generic semantics.
- Preserve `Ops.WMMA -> CMAC` as the only planned graph-level fast path.
